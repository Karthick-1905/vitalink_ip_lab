# Individual feature workflows

## Password, OTP, TOTP, and session issuance

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User
    participant App as Flutter app
    participant Auth as Auth controller
    participant DB as MongoDB
    participant Twilio as Twilio Verify

    User->>App: Submit login ID and password
    App->>Auth: POST /auth/login

    alt Doctor or patient phone verification required

        Auth-->>App: 202 OTP challenge
        App->>Auth: POST /auth/login/otp/verify
        Auth->>Twilio: Check code
        Auth->>DB: Mark phone verified and create AuthSession
    else Admin TOTP enabled
        Auth->>DB: Create TOTP login challenge
        Auth-->>App: 202 TOTP challenge
        App->>Auth: POST /auth/login/totp/verify
        Auth->>DB: Verify code, replay step, factor generation and challenge
        Auth->>DB: Create AuthSession
    else Admin enrollment required
        Auth->>DB: Create password-bound enrollment challenge
        Auth-->>App: 202 enrollment required
        App->>Auth: POST enrollment setup then activate
        Auth->>DB: Encrypt active TOTP secret and create AuthSession
    else No factor required
        Auth->>DB: Create AuthSession
    end
    Auth-->>App: Access token, opaque refresh token and session metadata
```

The Flutter OTP form uses `resend_available_at`, remaining attempts, and max resends from the challenge payload. Resend stays disabled during cooldown or after the resend budget is exhausted; verify is blocked when the challenge is expired or has no attempts left.

When login returns `TOTP_ENROLLMENT_REQUIRED`, the Flutter login page loads password-bound setup material (QR code and setup key) and activates the factor with the six-digit authenticator code before a session is issued. Challenge expiry and lockout return the administrator to the password form; an invalid authenticator code stays on the enrollment form.

## Patient INR report upload

The Update INR form rejects empty, non-decimal, zero, and values above 20 before `POST /patient/reports`, matching `reportSchema`.

```mermaid

    Gate -- No --> Reject["Reject without storage write"]
    Gate -- Yes --> Validate["Validate size, declared MIME, magic bytes and metadata"]

    Profile --> Success["Return created report"]
    Object -. later persistence failure .-> Compensate["Delete/retire object and asset"]
    Asset -. domain write failure .-> Compensate
```

## Dosage adherence and reminders

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Scheduled
    Scheduled --> ReminderEligible: dosage due and active therapy
    ReminderEligible --> NotificationCreated: unique reminder key inserted
    NotificationCreated --> PushOutbox: delivery intent persisted
    PushOutbox --> Delivered: worker succeeds before validity deadline
    PushOutbox --> Retryable: transient provider or queue failure
    Retryable --> PushOutbox: backoff and recovery enqueue
    Retryable --> DeadLetter: max attempts reached
    ReminderEligible --> Skipped: duplicate, feature disabled, or recipient ineligible
    Scheduled --> Taken: patient records dosage
    Scheduled --> Missed: scheduled date passes without taken dose
    Missed --> Escalated: threshold within configured window reached
    Escalated --> NotificationCreated
```

## Doctor review and care-plan update

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Roster["GET assigned patients"] --> Detail["Open patient detail"]
    Detail --> Authz["Re-check assignment, hospital and account state"]
    Authz --> Reports["View report history and temporary file URL"]
    Authz --> Dosage["Update weekly dosage"]
    Authz --> Instructions["Update care instructions"]
    Authz --> Review["Update next review date"]
    Authz --> Reassign["Reassign to eligible same-hospital doctor"]
    Reports --> Event["Persist doctor update/notification"]
    Dosage --> Event
    Instructions --> Event
    Review --> Event
    Reassign --> Event
    Event --> Patient["Patient reads update through REST, SSE, or optional push"]
```

## Hospital and account lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Active
    Active --> Suspending: authorized suspension
    Suspending --> Suspended: membership writes fenced, hospital access blocked, sessions revoked
    Suspending --> Suspending: interrupted transition remains resumable
    Suspended --> Activating: authorized reactivation
    Activating --> Active: hospital access restored, account statuses preserved
    Activating --> Activating: interrupted transition remains resumable
    Active --> Inactive: authorized deactivation path
```

Hospital lifecycle uses a lease and monotonic generation. Doctor lifecycle and patient assignment use related leases/fences so stale workers cannot safely resume after losing ownership.

## Administrator role-policy change

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Admin
    participant UI as Admin console
    participant API as Role-policy API
    participant DB as MongoDB transaction

    UI->>API: GET policy and current version
    API-->>UI: Fixed role, allowlist map and policy_version
    Admin->>UI: Change editable capability switches
    UI->>API: POST preview with expected_version
    API->>API: Validate role allowlist, mutation/read rules and protected invariants
    API-->>UI: Added/removed capabilities and affected account count
    UI->>API: PUT update with expected_version and reason
    API->>DB: Atomically compare version, update policy and append immutable revision
    alt Version is stale
        API-->>UI: 409 conflict with current policy
    else Update succeeds
        API-->>UI: New policy and incremented version
    end
```

## Notification delivery

```mermaid

    InApp --> Realtime["Publish to eligible SSE streams"]
    InApp --> Intent{"Push required?"}
    Intent -- No --> Done["REST/in-app delivery only"]
    Intent -- Yes --> Outbox["Upsert NotificationDelivery by idempotency key"]
    Outbox --> Queue["Publish delivery ID to BullMQ"]
    Queue --> Claim["Worker claims Mongo lease"]
    Claim --> Valid{"Recipient and clinical validity still valid?"}
    Valid -- No --> Skip["SKIPPED"]
    Valid -- Yes --> FCM["Send generic push through Firebase"]
    FCM --> Result{"Provider outcome"}
    Result -- Success --> Succeeded["SUCCEEDED"]
    Result -- Transient --> Retry["FAILED_RETRYABLE with next_attempt_at"]
    Result -- Permanent or exhausted --> Dead["DEAD_LETTER"]
    Retry --> Recovery["Worker/recovery poller republishes due row"]
    Recovery --> Claim
```

## Billing checkout and settlement

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor HospitalAdmin
    participant API as Billing API
    participant DB as Invoice collection
    participant Provider as Configured HTTPS payment provider

    HospitalAdmin->>API: POST /admin/billing/checkout/{invoiceId}
    API->>DB: Verify tenant invoice, capability and unpaid state
    API->>DB: Reserve unique checkout session metadata
    API->>Provider: Create checkout with server-owned amount and invoice
    Provider-->>API: checkout_url
    API->>DB: Mark reserved session open and store URL
    API-->>HospitalAdmin: Checkout session details
    Provider->>API: POST /webhooks/payment with event, timestamp and HMAC
    API->>API: Verify skew, signature, amount, currency and session
    API->>DB: Idempotently mark session settled and invoice paid
    API-->>Provider: Settlement acknowledged
```

The provider brand and live endpoint are configuration, not source-backed facts.

## Runtime configuration and feature flags

    API --> Active["Single active SystemConfig document"]
    Active --> Cache["Configuration service cache"]

    Cache --> Reminders["Notification feature eligibility"]

    API --> Audit["Audit CONFIG_UPDATE outcome"]
```

### Administrator data loading states

Analytics, personal MFA, platform configuration, and hospital operations health distinguish a first-load failure from an empty result. A failed first load shows an error and an explicit retry. When a refresh fails after data loaded successfully, the page keeps that data visible, labels it as stale with its last successful load time, and shows the refresh error with a retry action. Configuration does not schedule another initial request after a failure; the administrator retries explicitly. Analytics section-level authorization denials remain distinct from request failures, and empty charts are shown only after the aggregate query succeeds.

### Lifecycle commit and recovery

Individual Doctor/Patient status routes, legacy deactivation routes, and batch activation/deactivation share one transition service. A MongoDB transaction commits `User.is_active`, `User.security_version`, patient `account_status`, and conflict-metadata cleanup. Expected account, hospital, assignment, and profile state must still match. Hospital and doctor lease documents participate in the transaction to reject superseded owners. Patient activation also excludes purged/purging profiles and requires an active same-hospital doctor. Deceased patients cannot be restored or discharged.

Transactions require a replica set. These transitions fail closed on standalone MongoDB; there is no independent-write fallback. Physical session cleanup runs after commit. `revocation_cleanup_completed: false` reports cleanup failure while the committed security version rejects old sessions.

Hospital suspension/inactivation blocks hospital access, bumps member security versions to invalidate in-flight login snapshots, and revokes existing sessions while preserving individual account and patient statuses. Reactivation restores access only for individually active accounts; users must sign in again after session revocation. Accounts disabled by earlier releases remain disabled and require explicit review before restoration. No automatic historical restoration is attempted.

### Patient management directory

The administrator patient directory shows login account status separately from clinical lifecycle status and includes the assigned doctor's display name. Its lifecycle filter includes Active, Discharged, Deceased, and AssignmentConflict; the doctor filter selects active doctors by name. Patient onboarding and reassignment use the paginated, searchable `GET /admin/doctors/assignment-options` lookup, which returns only active same-hospital doctor identity and eligibility and is authorized by `tenant.patients.manage` or `tenant.patients.assign`; the general doctor directory remains protected by `tenant.doctors.read`. AssignmentConflict is an operational quarantine: administrators with patient-assignment capability can use **Resolve assignment conflict** to reassign the patient through the guarded same-hospital assignment flow. Successful reassignment clears conflict metadata and returns the lifecycle status to Active. Deceased patients cannot be reassigned, reactivated, or discharged. AssignmentConflict patients cannot be activated until reassignment repairs the assignment.

### Maintenance recovery

The exact `/admin/access/me` bootstrap and `/admin/config` endpoints remain reachable during maintenance along with authentication, password/MFA recovery bootstrap, and health endpoints. Their normal authentication and authorization still apply. An Application Admin can sign in again, reload access, open configuration, and disable maintenance. Tenant application routes remain unavailable.

## Administrator account and one-time credential dialogs

Administrator invite and edit forms validate before submission, disable their controls during the request, and keep the dialog open until the request succeeds or fails. An edit that changes role or hospital scope previews the old and proposed access and warns that the administrator's active sessions will be revoked. After a successful edit, the page confirms completion and refreshes the account list. A successful invite presents any temporary password before refreshing the list, so a refresh failure cannot hide the one-time credential.

Doctor registration, patient onboarding, and administrator invitation show a one-time password in a result dialog when the API returns one. The operator must acknowledge that they recorded it for secure delivery before Done is enabled. Outside taps cannot dismiss these result dialogs. A missing temporary password is reported as successful creation without inventing a credential.
